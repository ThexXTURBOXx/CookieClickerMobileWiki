# Cookie Clicker Mobile Toolbox

## What is CCMobileToolbox?
It's a little program, written in Java, which enables support for:
- Transferring saves between different community patches (since 1.1.0 full support)
- Transferring and copying saves between devices
- Cheating (since 1.1.0 full support for manual cheating, e.g. editing files yourself)
- Backup of saves
- Restoring old backups

### Mac
Should be supported afaik, but I can't test it myself.<br>
In general, it should be nearly the same as on Linux, apart from installing the necessary applications (which might work differently, using `brew` maybe?).

### Cheating
If you want to cheat yourself cookies, buildings or anything else: Well, here you go:
1. Create a backup of your save with the toolbox as described here on this page (you may want to create 2, as you can quickly brick your save and consequently wipe it)
2. Go to the folder with your backup and go into ``apps/org.dashnet.cookieclicker*/f``
3. If you want to edit your live slot, edit the file ``CookieClickerSave.txt``. If you want to edit your alpha slot, edit the file ``CookieClickerSaveTest.txt``
4. Edit everything you want to edit in there
5. Restore the save with the toolbox as described here on this page
