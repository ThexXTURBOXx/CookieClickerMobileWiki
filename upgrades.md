That's why you've designed the universal converter, compatible with any substance and capable of turning those useless spoils of conquest into the reassuring crumbly rustle of even more cookies.</i> |

Of course, the denizens of that idleverse also have their own escape idleverse to abscond to in the eventuality of your arrival, itself likely having its own contingency idleverse, and so on.</i> |

But they also seem to be governed by much more subtle rules, the logic of which, when harnessed, may give you unparalleled dominion over the multiverse. Rewrite the rules! A game designer is you!</i> |

You've finally perfected the method of constructing your own self-propelled ports, which can travel near-instantaneously along universal perimeters to permit headache-free multiverse connections. Took you long enough.</i> |

Exercise infinite caution when handling these, for each of them, containing endless galaxies and supporting endless life, is more precious than you can ever fathom. They've also proven to be quite a smash hit in your warehouses on bowling night.</i> |

The more you wait on an idleverse, the more exponentially potent it becomes - which saves you a whole lot of hard work. In a true act of zen, you've taken to biding your time when collecting new universes, letting them ripen like a fine wine.</i> |

Grandpas, wind turbines, through the power of music, friendship, or legislation; those folks in there discovered ways to make cookies out of any random venue. Some of them don't even have idleverses, can you imagine?</i> |

New developments in lactotrophic technology replace this with a bath of 3 parts milk and 1 part rice vinegar, absorbed dermally, which also helps your clones pop out with positively glowing skin.</i> |

Imbuing your clones with a slightly more flattering physique, a slightly improved metabolism, or slightly deadlier laser eyes is as easy as pushing some stem cells around. Just don't build them too superior to your own self, lest they get any ideas.</i> |

Subtly, each clone's personality has branched off from yours, their shifting minds pulling them into discrete clone-born cultures, microcosms of other paths you yourself could've taken had life treated you differently. This living tree of possibilities proves to be a boon for your self-knowledge and decision-making skills, and you don't even have to pester your alternate selves in other realities for it.</i> |

No worries though, you've bred a new generation of extra-obedient copies, armed them to the teeth and given them full authority to deal with disorderly layabouts. It's fine. It's under control. It's fine.</i> |

But the same loophole allows you to claim each of them as dependents and earn some wicked tax benefits, so really, that "unalienable rights" racket is quite alright.</i> |

Happily, your duplicates seem bolstered by these reminders, having come to regard you as this half-divine, half-parental entity, hallowed ancestor of all clones and all cookies. You're just hoping your folks at the labs can put the finishing touches on your immortality cure soon, or you shudder to think of the inheritance disputes to come.</i> |

The clones maintaining your tunnels and vents can do with quite a few less limbs, while those working your labs don't mind the dexterity that comes with some extra.
