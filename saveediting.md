# Save Editing

## Converting Alpha Save to Live Save (Very easy - With these instructions, even your grandpa can do it)

### Using Weird Z the Cppkiemeister's Script

1. Install [adb](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/) if not installed already
2. Connect your phone to your computer via USB and [with Debugging enabled](https://www.embarcadero.com/starthere/xe5/mobdevsetup/android/en/enabling_usb_debugging_on_an_android_device.html)
3. On Windows, install the Git Bash or MinGW Bash
4. Download the Script in the [Discord Message](https://discordapp.com/channels/412363381891137536/581236824349868042/763114003064029245)
5. Do ``chmod +x ./restoreAlphaSave.sh`` to make it executable
6. Just do ``./restoreAlphaSave.sh`` and approve on your phone

### Manual conversion

1. Install [adb](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/) if not installed already
2. Connect your phone to your computer via USB and [with Debugging enabled](https://www.embarcadero.com/starthere/xe5/mobdevsetup/android/en/enabling_usb_debugging_on_an_android_device.html)
3. You have to execute the following command in the terminal now: ``adb backup org.dashnet.cookieclicker`` and confirm on your phone, which creates a file "backup.ab"
4. Use the [Android Backup Extractor](https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor/releases/download/20181012025725-d750899/abe-all.jar) to convert the ab-File to a tar-File using ``java -jar abe-all.jar unpack backup.ab backup.tar``
5. Extract the contents of the tar-file (using WinRAR, 7z or something like that) and copy the ``apps\org.dashnet.cookieclicker\f\CookieClickerSaveTest.txt`` as ``apps\org.dashnet.cookieclicker\f\CookieClickerSave.txt`` (this will basically override your live save with your test save)
6. Pack it into a tar-File again and convert it to an ab-File using ``java -jar abe-all.jar pack backup.tar backup.ab``
7. Do a ``adb restore backup.ab`` and confirm on your phone

## Cheating (Moderate - You should know or understand JSON)

1. Install [adb](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/) if not installed already
2. Connect your phone to your computer via USB and [with Debugging enabled](https://www.embarcadero.com/starthere/xe5/mobdevsetup/android/en/enabling_usb_debugging_on_an_android_device.html)
3. You have to execute the following command in the terminal now: ``adb backup org.dashnet.cookieclicker`` and confirm on your phone, which creates a file "backup.ab"
4. Use the [Android Backup Extractor](https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor/releases/download/20181012025725-d750899/abe-all.jar) to convert the ab-File to a tar-File using ``java -jar abe-all.jar unpack backup.ab backup.tar``
5. Extract the contents of the tar-file (using WinRAR, 7z or something like that) and go into the folder ``apps\org.dashnet.cookieclicker\f``.
6. If you want to cheat on your Live save, edit the file ``CookieClickerSave.txt``.<br>
If you want to cheat on your Alpha save, edit the file ``CookieClickerSaveTest.txt``.
7. Pack it into a tar-File again and convert it to an ab-File using ``java -jar abe-all.jar pack backup.tar backup.ab``
8. Do a ``adb restore backup.ab`` and confirm on your phone

## Converting between Community Patches (Moderate - Only do, if you know, what you are doing)

1. Install [adb](https://www.xda-developers.com/install-adb-windows-macos-linux/) if not installed already
2. Connect your phone to your computer via USB and [with Debugging enabled](https://www.embarcadero.com/starthere/xe5/mobdevsetup/android/en/enabling_usb_debugging_on_an_android_device.html)
3. Look up the package name of the patch, which you want to convert **FROM**. Let's say, in our case it was "org.dashnet.cookieclicker" (the original patch, just as an example)
4. You have to execute the following command in the terminal now: ``adb backup org.dashnet.cookieclicker`` and confirm on your phone, which creates a file "backup.ab"
5. Use the [Android Backup Extractor](https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor/releases/download/20181012025725-d750899/abe-all.jar) to convert the ab-File to a tar-File using ``java -jar abe-all.jar unpack backup.ab backup.tar``
6. Look up the package name of the patch, which you want to convert **TO**. Let's say, in our case it was "org.dashnet.cookieclickerSuperDuperCommunityPatch" (some community patch, just as an example)
7. Extract the contents of the tar-file (using WinRAR, 7z or something like that) and rename the folder ``apps\org.dashnet.cookieclicker`` to ``apps\org.dashnet.cookieclickerSuperDuperCommunityPatch``
8. Rename the previous "backup.ab" and "backup.tar" to "backupOld.ab" and "backupOld.tar" respectively
9. You have to execute the following command in the terminal now: ``adb backup org.dashnet.cookieclickerSuperDuperCommunityPatch`` and confirm on your phone, which creates another file "backup.ab"
10. Use the [Android Backup Extractor](https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor/releases/download/20181012025725-d750899/abe-all.jar) to convert the ab-File to a tar-File using ``java -jar abe-all.jar unpack backup.ab backup.tar``
11. Extract just the file ``backup.tar\apps\org.dashnet.cookieclickerSuperDuperCommunityPatch\_manifest`` and replace the ``apps\org.dashnet.cookieclickerSuperDuperCommunityPatch\_manifest`` from your previously extracted backup.
12. Pack the previously extracted folder into a tar-File again and convert it to an ab-File using ``java -jar abe-all.jar pack backup.tar backup.ab``
13. Do a ``adb restore backup.ab`` and confirm on your phone

## CCMobileToolbox (Very easy - BROKEN RIGHT NOW)

**RIGHT NOW, IT DOESN'T WORK, WILL MAYBE FIX LATER**<br>
The [Cookie Clicker Mobile Toolbox](toolbox) allows one to convert saves between patches and create backups and restore them.
