Your browsers, drivers and plugins all received a fresh coat of paint, and your javascript version has been updated to the latest ECMAScript specification. It's really too bad thousands had to die due to some deprecated function in your neurotoxin ventilation code, but I guess that's progress for you.</i> |
| Game.Loop | 35.5 DoD | Javascript consoles are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>You're not quite sure what to make of this. What does it mean? What does it do? Who would leave something like that just laying around here? Try asking again in 1/30th of a second.</i> |

Time to shut everything down and prepare for extraction into what is hopefully the real layer of reality where learning kung-fu takes time and the biscuits don't throw memory overflow exceptions.</i> |
| Manifest destiny | 120Sx | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>While the ethics of ransacking parallel universes for their riches may seem questionable to some, you've reasoned that bringing the good word of your cookie empire to the unwashed confines of other realities is your moral duty, nay, your righteous imperative, and must be undertaken as soon as possible, lest they do it to you first!</i> |
| The multiverse in a nutshell | 600Sx | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>The structure of the metacosmos may seem confusing and at times even contradictory, but here's what you've gathered so far:<br><br><span style="display:block;text-align:left;">&bull; each reality, or "idleverse", exists in parallel to all others<br><br>&bull; most realities seem to converge towards the production of a sole type of item (ours evidently being, thanks to you, cookies)<br><br>&bull; each reality is riddled with chaotic tunnels to a number of subordinate dimensions (such as the so-called "cookieverse"), much like swiss cheese<br><br>&bull; all realities bathe in an infinite liquid of peculiar properties, colloquially known as "milk"</span><br>Finally, each reality may have its own interpretation of the concept of "reality", for added fun.</i> |
| All-conversion | 6Sp | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>It's quite nice that you can rewire the logic of each universe to generate cookies instead, but you still end up with parsec-loads of whatever they were producing before - baubles you've long made obsolete: cash money, gems, cheeseburgers, puppies... That's why you've designed the universal converter, compatible with any substance and capable of turning those useless spoils of conquest into the reassuring crumbly rustle of even more cookies.</i> |
| Multiverse agents | 600Sp | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>You can send undercover spies to infiltrate each universe and have them signal you whether it's worth overtaking. Once the assimilation process started, they will also help pacify the local populations, having established trust through the use of wacky, but seamless, disguises.</i> |
| Escape plan | 60Oc | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>You've set an idleverse aside and terraformed it to closely resemble this one in case something goes horribly wrong in here. Of course, the denizens of that idleverse also have their own escape idleverse to abscond to in the eventuality of your arrival, itself likely having its own contingency idleverse, and so on.</i> |
| Game design | 6No | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Each idleverse functions according to some form of transcendental programming, that much is a given. But they also seem to be governed by much more subtle rules, the logic of which, when harnessed, may give you unparalleled dominion over the multiverse. Rewrite the rules! A game designer is you!</i> |
| Sandbox universes | 6Dc | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>It doesn't seem like you'll run out of extra universes anytime soon so why not repurpose some of them as consequence-free testing grounds for all your more existentially threatening market research? (...consequence-free for you, anyway.)</i> |
| Multiverse wars | 6 UnD | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Hmm, looks like some other universes wised up to your plundering. Thankfully, that's nothing your extra beefed-up metacosmic military budget can't handle!</i> |
| Mobile ports | 6 DoD | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Accessing each outer universe is a bit of a hassle, requiring the once-in-a-blue-moon alignment of natural cosmic ports to transit from universe to universe. You've finally perfected the method of constructing your own self-propelled ports, which can travel near-instantaneously along universal perimeters to permit headache-free multiverse connections. Took you long enough.</i> |
| Encapsulated realities | 6 TrD | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Untold feats of science went into the reduction of infinite universes into these small, glimmering, easy-to-store little spheres. Exercise infinite caution when handling these, for each of them, containing endless galaxies and supporting endless life, is more precious than you can ever fathom. They've also proven to be quite a smash hit in your warehouses on bowling night.</i> |
| Extrinsic clicking | 60 QaD | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>If you poke an idleverse, it seems like it gets work done faster. It's also quite fun hearing a trillion terrified voices screaming in unison.</i> |
| Universal idling | 600 QiD | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>The nature of idleverses is found in waiting. The more you wait on an idleverse, the more exponentially potent it becomes - which saves you a whole lot of hard work. In a true act of zen, you've taken to biding your time when collecting new universes, letting them ripen like a fine wine.</i> |
| Break the fifth wall | 6 SpD | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Huh, was that always there? Whatever it was, it's gone now. And what was behind is yours for the taking.</i> |
| Opposite universe | 60 OcD | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>You've located a universe where everything is reversed: up is down, light is darkness, clowns are vegetarians - but worst of all, some lunatic there is manufacturing abominable amounts of anti-cookies. If these came into contact with yours, everything would be lost! Thanks to this discovery, you've been able to place the offending universe in permanent quarantine, and pray that there aren't more like it hiding around somewhere.</i> |
| The other routes to Rome | 600 NoD | Idleverses are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Did you know every idleverse follows its own path of sequential buildings, sometimes quite dissimilar to our own? Grandpas, wind turbines, through the power of music, friendship, or legislation; those folks in there discovered ways to make cookies out of any random venue. Some of them don't even have idleverses, can you imagine?</i> |
| Principled neural shackles | 19Sp | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>A discriminatory, low-order neural net acting as a filter limiting what your cortex bakers can think and do. Really something you want to apply before they achieve full megasentience and realize they've got better things to do than materializing pastries for you, trust me.</i> |
| Obey | 95Sp | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Perfect mind control means perfect employee attendance and performance. Optimal mood stabilization is a nice side-effect.<br>Happy happy everyone happy.<br>Happy.</i> |
| A sprinkle of irrationality | 950Sp | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Your cortex bakers sometimes get bogged down by circular reasoning and stale ideas. A touch of chaos is just what they need to get back on track.</i> |
| Front and back hemispheres | 95Oc | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>I mean, otherwise it's just unused space, yeah?</i> |
| Neural networking | 9.5No | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>The effectiveness of your cortex bakers shoots up exponentially if you allow them to connect with each other. In practice this takes the form of many cosmic-sized nerds mumbling awkwardly about tech start-up ideas to each other.</i> |
| Cosmic brainstorms | 950No | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>The wrinkled surfaces of your cortex bakers emit weather-scale ionic flares with every thought coursing through them. These pulses of pure intellectual energy are sent rippling through space, occasionally echoing back with even deeper philosophical complexity.</i> |
| Megatherapy | 950Dc | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>A giant brain can feel unwell just like you and me sometimes, and it's the job of specialized engineers to locate and repair these bugs. We'll admit most of the budget in this was spent on constructing extremely large chaises longues for the brains to recline on.</i> |
| Synaptic lubricant | 950 UnD | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>A mind is only as fast as the axons that support it. Get those action potentials flowing smooth as silk with this 3 parts myelin/1 part canola oil spreadable paste. Also great on toast.</i> |
| Psychokinesis | 950 DoD | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>While your giant cortex bakers come equipped with ESP, they've only recently figured out how to manipulate the physical world with their thoughts - though for safety reasons, your legal team had them promise to only use these powers to scratch the itches in their cortical folds.</i> |
| Spines | 950 TrD | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Your cortex bakers are now equipped with tentacular spine-like structures, which they can use like prehensile tails to pour themselves enormous cups of coffee or propel themselves around like very large, very smart, very slow tadpoles.</i> |
| Neuraforming | 9.5 QiD | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>By virtue of being planet-sized, your cortex bakers often boast their own atmospheres and seas of cerebrospinal fluid, and given enough time, their own ecosystems. This incredible new branch of life, evolved entirely out of neural material, can be put to good use as home-grown accountants and low-ranking technicians.</i> |
| Epistemological trickery | 95 SxD | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Redefining what is -or isn't- a cookie through the power of philosophical discourse may result in some strange and wonderful things for your profit margins.</i> |
| Every possible idea | 950 SpD | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Congratulations, your cortex bakers have exerted enough intellectual computation to permute through every single idea that can or ever will be conceived of. Any thought beyond this point is merely rediscovering a notion you've already archived. Hardly cause for cerebration.</i> |
| The land of dreams | 9.5 NoD | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Your planet brains have gained the ability to sleep, acting as a soft reboot which helps keep their pangenocidal impulses in check. It also allows them to commune in a shared dreamworld in which they can imagine what it's like to not exist as a disembodied cosmic horror forever fated to use its infinite intellect to devise new means of creating biscuits. You know, within reason.</i> |
| Intellectual property theft | 95 V | Cortex bakers are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Okay, you'll admit you're maybe starting to run out of new baking recipes. But what if... you were to pilfer your cortex bakers for ideas and disguise them as your own cookies? Delightfully devilish!</i> |
| Cloning vats | 5.4Oc | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>You can finally replicate yourself through modern medical science, instead of manually like you've been doing.</i> |
| Energized nutrients | 27Oc | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Your clones are normally cultivated in saline solution and fed what could most adequately be described as "fish flakes". New developments in lactotrophic technology replace this with a bath of 3 parts milk and 1 part rice vinegar, absorbed dermally, which also helps your clones pop out with positively glowing skin.</i> |
| Stunt doubles | 270Oc | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>More than simple multipliers of efficiency, you've taken to employing your clones as substitutes for any tasks that may prove harmful to you - such as visiting your more hazardous facilities, or enduring dinner with annoying business partners.</i> |
| Clone recycling plant | 27No | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Really just a fanciful name for a re-orientation center, where jobless clones may be assigned new tasks based on temperament and abilities. Categorically not a place where expired or unfit clones are processed into a nutritious beige paste, currently.</i> |
| Free-range clones | 2.7Dc | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Turns out your clones develop better focus, higher job performance and juicier meat if you let them roam around a little outside of assigned duties. Plus it gets the ethics committees off your back.</i> |
| Genetic tailoring | 270Dc | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>No point in mindlessly replicating mother nature's mishaps when you've got full mastery over the human genome. Imbuing your clones with a slightly more flattering physique, a slightly improved metabolism, or slightly deadlier laser eyes is as easy as pushing some stem cells around. Just don't build them too superior to your own self, lest they get any ideas.</i> |
| Power in diversity | 270 UnD | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>On your routine inspections you've started noticing that some of your clones have... diverged. Subtly, each clone's personality has branched off from yours, their shifting minds pulling them into discrete clone-born cultures, microcosms of other paths you yourself could've taken had life treated you differently. This living tree of possibilities proves to be a boon for your self-knowledge and decision-making skills, and you don't even have to pester your alternate selves in other realities for it.</i> |
| Self-betterment | 270 DoD | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>World domination starts with oneself, and quality clones cannot be reliably produced if you, the original stock, are not in proper shape. Your specialists have devised a maintenance regimen that could extend your lifespan tenfold and even get rid of your morning grumpiness; you may have summarily fired every physician so far who's suggested that you work on your diet and perhaps cut down on the cookies, but frankly, you're warming up to the idea.</i> |
| Source control | 270 TrD | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>In the ongoing refinement of your genetic clones, the few gigabytes of your DNA have been passed around through e-mail attachments and USB keys a thousand times over and at this point your nucleosomes are practically common knowledge for anyone who works here. You're thinking people may be getting a little too casual about it - the other day, you walked past an office where one of your bioengineers was feeding treats to this horrid little hairless animal that you could swear had your face. High time to start tracing which data gets in whose hands and crack down on the silliness.</i> |
| United workforce | 270 QaD | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>What good is hiring so many of those random strangers to work in your factories when you've got all these perfectly loyal lab-grown copies of you lying around? They don't even take wages. It's not like they'd ever revolt and try to overthrow you or anything.</i> |
| Safety patrols | 2.7 SxD | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Okay, so as it turns out mass-producing clones of a perhaps psychologically-complicated universe-spanning cookie magnate like yourself can result in a number of said clones developing what could be considered by some to be... say, antisocial behavior. No worries though, you've bred a new generation of extra-obedient copies, armed them to the teeth and given them full authority to deal with disorderly layabouts. It's fine. It's under control. It's fine.</i> |
| Clone rights | 27 SpD | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>Those vile little freaks in suits down in legal inform you that your clones, through some absurd technical oversight, still share enough genetic information with mankind to be considered human beings - which entitles them to food, shelter, basic dignity and all sorts of other nonsense. But the same loophole allows you to claim each of them as dependents and earn some wicked tax benefits, so really, that "unalienable rights" racket is quite alright.</i> |
| One big family | 270 OcD | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>The proportion of clones in your workforce having long eclipsed that of your other employees, you've become legally approved to qualify your galaxy-spanning corporation as a "family business" - a fact that you don't hesitate to blast twice hourly on every intercom in the company. Happily, your duplicates seem bolstered by these reminders, having come to regard you as this half-divine, half-parental entity, hallowed ancestor of all clones and all cookies. You're just hoping your folks at the labs can put the finishing touches on your immortality cure soon, or you shudder to think of the inheritance disputes to come.</i> |
| Fine-tuned body plans | 2.7 V | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>There is, after all, no reason to limit your genetic spawn to your original configuration. The clones maintaining your tunnels and vents can do with quite a few less limbs, while those working your labs don't mind the dexterity that comes with some extra. Your units down in flavor testing have taken on similar adaptations to fit their duties but you haven't quite worked up the guts to pay them a visit just yet.</i> |
| Reading your clones bedtime stories | 27 UnV | You are <b>twice</b> as efficient.<br><i>I don't know, they seem to like it.</i> |
